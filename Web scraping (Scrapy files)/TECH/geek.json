Now, a new company called BioCarbon Engineering plans to use UAVs to wage war, too\u2026 against deforestation.</p>", "<p>CEO Lauren Fletcher is a former <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/nasa/\">NASA</a> engineer, and he and his team are shooting (quite literally) for <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/exnasa-man-to-plant-one-billion-trees-a-year-using-drones-10160588.html\" target=\"_blank\">a billion trees a year</a>. They\u2019re working with drone experts at VulcanUAV, who don\u2019t build dainty little flying machines that let you spy on your neighbors. They build muscular machines that can carry payloads up to 8 kilograms \u2014 perfect for the kind of work BioCarbon has planned.</p>", "<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118457337?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0?wmode=transparent\" width=\"590\" height=\"332\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "<p>Their planting system is a bit like a drone-mounted paintball gun.\u00a0A pressurized air canister provides the force required to fire \u201crounds\u201d into the ground. Instead of paintballs, the drones will shoot biodegradable, spherical pods which contain pre-germinated seeds and a nutrient-rich gel. Apart from serving up a nutritional boost to the seeds, the gel also provides a bit of protection during impact.</p>", "<p>Before BioCarbon\u2019s UAVs are sent out on a reforestation run, another set of drones head to the drop zone to do a bit of scouting. They produce detailed 3D maps of the area, which helps the team figure out where to send the planting drones and maximizes success rates.</p>", "<p>BioCarbon\u2019s drone fleet has some major advantages over traditional re-planting methods. For one thing, it\u2019s cheaper than paying van loads of university students to manually plant trees while listening to Phish MP3s. It\u2019s also more efficient than aerial drops, where there\u2019s no guarantee that the seeds will actually germinate and take root.</p>"], "link": "http://www.geek.com/science/ex-nasa-engineer-wants-to-use-drones-to-plant-a-billion-trees-a-year-1621454/"},

Some people are excited that Nintendo is finally on mobile platforms, while others feel Nintendo is \u201cselling out\u201d \u2014 but this whole situation has people asking a question that is only becoming more and more important to gamers at-large: is free-to-play the future of gaming?</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/iphone-6-pokemon-shuffle-590x330.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1620349 size-full\" src=\"http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/iphone-6-pokemon-shuffle-590x330.jpg\" alt=\"Pokemon Shuffle\" width=\"590\" height=\"330\"></a></p>", "<p>Let\u2019s talk terminology for a second. What\u2019s the difference between \u201cfree-to-play\u201d and \u201cfreemium\u201d games? There isn\u2019t one. They are two terms used to describe the same business model: give users a basic content loop for free, offer extra content for a price, and get them to pay for \u201cpremium\u201d service. Hence the name \u201cfreemium.\u201d \u201cFree\u201d plus \u201cpremium.\u201d The games are free to download and (technically) free to play, but the free content is simple, and any and all \u201cpremium content\u201d (including levels, extra lives, shortened waiting times, and so on) is for purchase only. They seek to get users hooked on the basic game so that they are willing to pay for more. The alternative to buying those in-game perks usually involves waiting a long period of time to be able to continue playing, or building up ridiculous amounts of in-game currency to purchase these things with in-game points.</p>", "<p>For example, in a game like <em>Candy Crush</em>, if you lose all of your lives then you have to wait a set amount of time for them to replenish \u2014 or you can purchase those lives\u00a0with real money and get them automatically. Because the player wants to continue playing the game, they might make the decision to buy those lives for a fee.</p>", "<p>According to the 2014 Entertainment Software Association\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ESA_EF_2014.pdf\">yearly report</a>, casual games are the most popular genre in mobile play, making up 46% of games played. 47% of free-to-play games have an average of $0.25 spent per household each day. Multiply that by hundreds, thousands, millions of users, and you have a lot of money. In 2012, apps earned $10 billion dollars in revenue, and games were 80% of those purchases.</p>", "<p>So, why the two names? You\u2019ll see companies who make freemium games call them \u201cfree-to-play\u201d more often than not. It has a nice sound to it: \u201cfree to play\u201d makes it seem like it\u2019s just a free game, no payment involved. What goes unsaid is that these games are \u201cfree to play,\u201d but not \u201cfree to play in their entirety.\u201d Just calling them \u201cfree-to-play\u201d avoids that unseemly caveat. \u201cFreemium,\u201d on the other hand, has a negative connotation due in part to the <em>South Park</em> episode \u201cFreemium Isn\u2019t Free,\u201d in which Stan gets addicted to freemium games. The episode breaks down the freemium model and heavily criticizes it for being deceptive and exploitative.</p>", "<p><iframe src=\"https://secure.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=GrhRFSaMSQa2VcOMM3ub9A&amp;partner=southpark&amp;sourceUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fsouthpark.cc.com%2Fclips%2F44wh2k%2Fseeing-through-the-charade%23source%3D08f60a6f-24a8-4d88-88a3-eb5588494cbc%3Ac6cbd5e3-7eae-4cc3-94b7-119c8d412f99%26position%3D76%26sort%3Dairdate&amp;embed_age_gate_intro=true?wmode=transparent\" width=\"590\" height=\"331\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "<p><iframe src=\"https://secure.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=r7TGbk4f7DvW0IgSaEQrig&amp;partner=southpark&amp;sourceUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fsouthpark.cc.com%2Fclips%2Fsrfuqa%2Feveryone-is-doing-this%23source%3D08f60a6f-24a8-4d88-88a3-eb5588494cbc%3Ac6cbd5e3-7eae-4cc3-94b7-119c8d412f99%26position%3D81%26sort%3Dairdate&amp;embed_age_gate_intro=true?wmode=transparent\" width=\"590\" height=\"331\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "<p>Whether games are called \u201cfree-to-play,\u201d \u201cfree-to-start,\u201d or \u201cfreemium,\u201d they\u2019re selling you the same business model.</p>", "<p>Where did this trend in game development come from?\u00a0It started with DLC, which has been around for way\u00a0longer than many give it credit for. It used to be free, but pretty minimal because early systems had limited internet support. Microsoft pretty much patented DLC as we know it with the Xbox Live, bringing extra content to games such as <em>Halo 2</em> and <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</p>", "<p>It wasn\u2019t until the generation of consoles like Xbox 360 and PS3 that DLC started to become a widely accepted and used concept, and became a commodity to pay for. Even Nintendo <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/games/fire-emblem-awakening-first-to-get-paid-dlc-on-3ds-1452881/\">jumped on that bandwagon</a>.</p>", "<p>That approach translated naturally to social gaming. Remember <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/farmville/\"><em>FarmVille</em></a>? Remember the original <em>Words With Friends</em>? Back in 2009-2010 they were the most exciting things in social network development because they were harnessing a huge amount of Facebook\u2019s user base and generating a surprising amount of money. Those games ran on getting other people to play, and if not that then paying for in-game content. Those games died out as gaming started shifting over to mobile \u2014 titles such as <em><a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/plants-vs-zombies/\">Plants Vs. Zombies</a>\u00a0</em>and <em>Fruit Ninja</em> became popular. Remember back when those games were free?</p>", "<p>Old game models that are tried and true are now given new skins and in-game app purchases. Look at <em>Words With Friends</em> (AKA digital <em>Scrabble</em>), or <em>Candy Crush</em> (AKA <em>Bejeweled</em>). The latter is one of the most famous mobile games around right now, with <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/25/investing/king-digital-ipo\">93 million users playing daily</a> and an annual revenue of $1.9 billion dollars. Yeah, <em>billion</em>.</p>", "<p>Mobile games are diversified for all different audiences to broaden their appeal\u00a0and attract more users \u2014 so where you have \u201ccasual\u201d games like <em>Angry</em> Birds, you also have \u201cmoderate\u201d games such as the strategy MMO <em>Clash of Clans</em> <a href=\"http://developers.magmic.com/demographic-breakdown-casual-mid-core-hard-core-mobile-gamers/\">reporting revenue of $700,000 per day</a>.</p>", "<p>Where one idea makes money, other companies expand it to make more.</p>", "<p>Next page: <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/rant/will-the-future-of-gaming-be-free-to-play-1620348/2/\">The dark side of the future</a></p>"], "link": "http://www.geek.com/games/will-the-future-of-gaming-be-free-to-play-1620348/"},

That process requires a temperature of 800 degrees Celsius, but Audi says they use heat recovery to ensure an efficient system and green energy sources for the initial heating.</p>", "<p>CO2 then reacts with the hydrogen in a synthesis reactor under pressure at high temperature to produce a liquid called blue crude.
