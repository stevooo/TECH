With names like Daenerys, Targaryen and Clegane flying about, a modern program\u2019s spell-checking feature can become quite the frustration for an author looking to create an authentic fantasy settings.</p> <p>Martin may no longer have reason to fear Office, though, as the world\u2019s most popular word processor now recognizes <em>most</em> names from the <em>Game of Thrones</em> universe. These include fan favorites like Daenerys, Tyrion and Arya, among many others. Only minor characters are left out, such as Mossador, Gared and Mycah.</p> <p>You might think this would be common, but in fact the breadth of Office\u2019s love for the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series is unusual. Fans of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> have long had to deal with the fact important\u00a0characters like Gimli and Arwen aren\u2019t recognized.

This apparently has to do with the \u201cdata sources\u201d that Microsoft combs when considering words to add to its dictionary. The company didn\u2019t reveal what those sources are, but apparently the recent surge in popularity of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> was noticed as it combed for words to add.</p> <p>That\u2019s unlikely to lure Martin to a newer machine \u2014 it doesn\u2019t solve the problem for new characters and locations, after all \u2014 but it\u2019s good news for anyone planning to write their own recap, review or fan-fiction based on the popular books or TV series.

Or maybe you\u2019re finally following your dream of becoming greater than Spielberg. Either way, that\u2019s where the <a href=\"http://shop.soloshot.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">SoloShot2\u00a0</a>comes in. It\u2019s a robot, and unless you hang out with professional cameramen, the SoloShot is a way better cameraman than any of your friends.</p> <p>In the most basic sense, SoloShot is a robotic camera base for a tripod\u00a0that comes with a smart tag that the base can track. The base can pan 360 degrees at 80 degrees per second and tilt 140 degrees at 35\u00a0degrees per\u00a0second,\u00a0and can do all of this\u00a0while following and focusing on the tag, which the video subject can\u00a0simply strap on. Between 10 and 2,000 feet, the tag\u00a0can be detected for automatic zoom. It\u2019s also waterproof and shock resistant for extreme kayakers, swimmers, surprise rainstorms, and other wet conditions. The base <em>isn\u2019t</em> waterproof or shock resistant, though, so treat it gently and keep it covered.</p> <a class=\"wp-image-756493\" href=\"http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/soloshot-tag-830x533.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-756493\" src=\"http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/soloshot-tag-830x533.jpg\" alt=\"Soloshot tag\" width=\"830\" height=\"533\"></a> <p>Up to 10 SoloShot bases and tags can be strung together to film\u00a0multiple angles or subjects. Picture it\u00a0\u2014 pun intended\u00a0\u2014 as\u00a0a robotic production crew that offers no complaints and requires no lunch breaks. You can also track multiple tags using one base.</p> <p>Using the Camera Controller accessory, the tag itself can act as a remote control. Change your zoom settings or toggle\u00a0on and off from a distance. With DSLRs the tag can trigger burst shots of up to 45 seconds. SoloShot is also a great choice for nature studies or time-lapse photography; it\u2019s perfect to set up in a blind to monitor animals that avoid people, and it\u2019s easy to pre-program pan and tilt degrees over a given time period.</p> <a class=\"wp-image-756494\" href=\"http://icdn9.digitaltrends.com/image/soloshot-watersports-2-959x639.jpg\" style=\"width: 830px;\"><span class=\"zoom-button\"></span><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-756494\" src=\"http://icdn9.digitaltrends.com/image/soloshot-watersports-2-959x639.jpg\" alt=\"soloshot watersports 2\" width=\"830\" height=\"553\"></a> <p>The SoloShot is darn cool, but it needs a camera to work. It supports up to 5 lbs, and the controller works with both <a href=\"http://www.soloshot.com/dslr-compatible-cameras/\" target=\"_blank\">DSLR\u00a0</a>cameras\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.soloshot.com/help/cameracontrollerfirmware/\" target=\"_blank\">camcorders</a>\u00a0with a standard quarter-inch tripod thread. If you don\u2019t have\u00a0a camera, you can get the SoloShot2 bundle that comes with a base and tag, a Sony CX405 Camcorder, a camera controller and a tripod.</p> <p>There are some limitations; the base has to be stationary, so no shots from a moving car or boat. It also won\u2019t work inside; outdoor use only. Still, all the things SoloShot2\u00a0<em>can\u00a0</em>do come in really handy for solo artists and extreme athletes who need an on-call cameraman.</p> <p>The bundle with everything is $650, and you can get different setups or buy additional bases, tags and controllers if\u00a0you need them.

These are rated for a thermal design power of 35 watts.</p> <p><strong>Related</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-core-m-efficiency-notebook-tested/\">Testing the battery life of Intel\u2019s Core M processors</a></p> <p>The standard run of chips don\u2019t have a letter at the end, and are mostly standard desktop chips that target a 65 watt TDP.

In this release plan, each \u201ctick\u201d steps down the size of a chip to a smaller\u00a0die size, sometimes adding new processing power, but mostly focusing on shrinking the processor\u2019s physical size.

There\u2019s no shortage of content to stream these days, and there are tons of different services out there vying for your attention. But with so many services out there offering up am ever-evolving slew of programming, how do you know which one to subscribe to?</p> <p>This article is intended to be a concise comparison of some of the top streaming services available. Below, you\u2019ll find them stacked against each other and compared in the areas of content selection, pricing, and availability to help you find the service that best suits your needs.</p> <p><strong>Related:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/netflix-hulu-plus-amazon-instant-video/\">Battle of the streaming giants: Netflix vs. Amazon Instant vs. Hulu Plus\u00a0</a></p> <div class=\"item-grid cols-1\"> <div> <h3><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/us-en/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-754867 size-full\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2015/04/netflix-header-pic-2.png\" alt=\"Netflix Browse Screen\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> <p>We\u2019ll start with the obvious. Even if you were living in a cave for the past decade, you probably still had Netflix deliver DVD\u2019s to your stone mailbox. Back in 1997, that\u2019s exactly how the company got its start, but after realizing that physical media was dying off, it rapidly adapted its\u00a0business model to focus more on instantly-available streaming content. The company has been king of the media streaming jungle ever since.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: Netflix doesn\u2019t specify the number of movies and shows available in their library beyond just saying that it numbers in the thousands, which is vague, but nonetheless accurate. Netflix has the most robust content library of any streaming service out there. The selection leans more toward feature-length movies, but its\u00a0collection of TV shows is constantly growing and improving. Netflix even offers its own highly successful TV shows, including <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, and <em>House of Cards. </em>2015 promises even more from Netflix, with successful productions of\u00a0<em>Bloodline </em>and\u00a0<em>Daredevil</em>.</p> <p><strong>Price</strong>: Netflix streaming service starts at $9 a month for new customers, and also gives you the option to get physical DVD\u2019s sent to your mailbox one at a time for the same price \u2013 but seriously, who wants to do that anymore? Netflix also offers a $12 \u201cplatinum plan,\u201d which unlocks\u00a0Netflix\u2019s growing collection of 4K content, and expands the number of devices that can stream at once to four.</p> <p><strong>Availability</strong>: Hardware compatibility is off the charts high. Because Netflix got into the streaming game early, it\u2019s\u00a0been picked up by all kinds of devices. You can get it on everything from gaming consoles, to streaming boxes, to your smartphone. Nearly every mainstream app store has a Netfilx app.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Netflix is a solid choice. The content selection continues to grow over time with a good number of new releases each week. The library of TV shows isn\u2019t as robust as what you\u2019ll find on Hulu, but Netflix is completely ad-free.</p> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/primesignup?tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=43548486648&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11942854126565821900&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_9lkx4do8le_b\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime Instant Video</a></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-754852 size-full\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2015/04/amazon-header-pic-1.png\" alt=\"Amazon Prime Instant Video Browse\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> <p>Amazon: it\u00a0started with selling books online, and now it\u2019s the Walmart of the Internet. Amazon\u00a0sells everything, and a few years ago the company\u00a0broke into the media streaming market with Amazon Prime Instant Video.</p> <p><strong>Content: </strong>Amazon\u2019s streaming site\u00a0started off as a pay-per-view\u00a0service, but as it gained traction, it expanded to include subscription-based on-demand video streaming to Amazon Prime subscribers. The library used to be small in comparison to that of Netflix, but recently Amazon has been using its industry clout to sign partnerships with companies like Epix and Warner Bros. The content library has ballooned as a result and includes Amazon Studio exclusives like <em>Alpha House </em>and\u00a0<em>Transparent.</em></p> <p><strong>Price</strong>: Amazon Prime Instant Video comes as part of the Amazon Prime bundle, which costs either $99 a year or $8.25 per month. If you order a lot of merchandise\u00a0from\u00a0Amazon, Prime is a no-brainer. In addition to the streaming services, you also get free two-day shipping on your Amazon orders. This is easily the best deal in the bunch, even if you don\u2019t order stuff from Amazon.</p> <p><strong>Availability</strong>: APIV is available on most major set-top streaming boxes, as well as most major gaming consoles, tablets, and smartphones.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Amazon puts pretty much everything at your fingertips \u2013 whether it\u2019s instant streaming content, pay-per view movies and shows, or digital media you can buy and own. Based on how quickly Amazon\u2019s service has grown in the past year alone, it\u2019s likely that APIV will continue to expand its content library and availability to rival or surpass that of Netflix. Time will tell.</p> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/plus/specialoffer1?cmp=5373&amp;mkwid=PpepViYq&amp;pcrid=66213213875&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=BND%7CCore%7CHulu+Plus&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=hulu%20plus&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwjd2pBRDB4o_ymcieoAQSJABm4egobp7_ZhJ-d8Th5DMHLqWQE4W5ssEx_C6D5vetJKDQOBoC8tLw_wcB&amp;dclid=COnMzd2Hi8UCFQsWhQodqRcAaA\" target=\"_blank\">Hulu Plus</a></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-754856 size-full\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2015/04/Hulu-Plus-header-pic-1.png\" alt=\"Hulu Plus Browse\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> <p>Hulu was created in 2007 as a joint venture between veteran media broadcasters NBC Universal, Fox Broadcasting, and Disney-ABC. The media streaming service was originally completely free, but rolled out subscription-based Hulu Plus after the service gained a massive following.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: Hulu has a modest selection of movies, but no other streaming service can hold a candle to its library of TV shows. Netflix and Amazon tend to get TV shows after the season ends, or after they\u2019ve gone off the air completely \u2013 but Hulu, in addition to having a long list of older shows and programs, posts new episodes of shows currently playing on cable just days (and sometimes hours) after they air. The only downside is that even though\u00a0you pay for Hulu Plus, you\u2019ll still be forced to sit through ads.</p> <p><strong>Price</strong>: Hulu has tons of free content that might satisfy the needs of the occasional TV watcher, but if you want access to Hulu\u2019s full and regularly-updated library of current shows, a Hulu Plus subscription is the only way to go. It\u2019ll cost you $7.99 per month, which is considerably cheaper than cable, but it\u2019s also generally a day or two behind.</p> <p><strong>Availability</strong>: Hulu is everywhere. You can get it on just about every set-top streaming box, internet-enabled TV, smartphone, or tablet.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:\u00a0</strong>Hulu Plus is great for TV. You\u2019ll get access to a Hulu\u2019s large library of TV shows and even some full-length movies. And it\u2019s constantly updating. Unlike Netflix and Amazon, the most recent TV show episodes usually appear on Hulu the day after airing.</p> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"https://www.sling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sling TV</a></h3> <div class=\"m-credited-image alignnone\"> <a class=\"wp-image-715454\" href=\"http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/dish-sling-tv-app-1500x1000.jpg?ver=4\" style=\"width: 970px;\"><span class=\"zoom-button\"></span><img class=\" wp-image-715454 aligncenter\" src=\"http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/dish-sling-tv-app-1500x1000.jpg?ver=4\" alt=\"DISH-Sling-TV-app\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" data-image-id=\"715454\"></a> <div class=\"m-image-credit\" data-image-id=\"715454\">Rich Shibley/Digital Trends</div> </div> <p>Sling is the newcomer to this bunch. Released in 2015 as a supplement to subscription sites like Hulu and Netflix, Sling will stream live TV from networks like ESPN, Comedy Central, AMC, and TNT. There\u2019s no contract or cancellation fees.</p> <p><strong>Content:\u00a0</strong>Originally for cord-cutters looking to gain access to ESPN without paying a cable subscription, Sling now has over 200 channels in 18 languages and is continually adding more. ESPN alone might be enough for sport fans to ditch their cable subscription. You can upgrade your subscription to include HBO Live to stream\u00a0<em>Game of Thrones.\u00a0</em></p> <p><strong>Price: </strong>Baseline services with\u00a0Sling will cost you $20 per month. It\u2019s significantly more expensive than Netflix and Amazon Instant, but far less expensive than regular cable subscriptions that\u2019ll run you between $60-90 per month. You can add bundles of additional networks for $5 per package. HBO live will cost an additional $15.</p> <p><strong>Availability:\u00a0</strong>Sling\u2019s availability is limited. You can download the app and run it on your\u00a0Amazon Fire TV Box and Stick and Roku TVs as well as most Apple devices running on iOS 7 or later, and\u00a0the\u00a0Xbox One.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:\u00a0</strong>Sling is ideal for sports fans and cord cutters, but it\u2019s not an alternative to your 85-channel cable subscription. However,\u00a0those who just want ESPN and ESPN 2 without dropping a premium for cable, Sling TV is worth a shot, considering it doesn\u2019t require signing any contract and offers a far lower price than traditional cable subscriptions.</p> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a></h3> <img class=\" size-full wp-image-754862 aligncenter\" src=\"http://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/youtube-header-pic-1-970x647.png\" alt=\"Youtube header pic 1\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> <p>Here\u2019s a fun fact: YouTube was founded on Valentines Day in 2005 \u2013 which could be why everyone fell in love with it. Google bought the site for around 1.6 billion dollars just a year after its inception, and since then the simple video hosting service has amassed an unfathomably large user base. Just don\u2019t read the comments.</p> <p><strong>Content:</strong> YouTube hosts just about everything that isn\u2019t porn. You can find everything on here from small children pondering existentialism while loopy on nitrous oxide, to Joe Rogan\u2019s reaction to two women eating each other\u2019s excrement out of a cup. Sure, there\u2019s a lot of junk and downright weird stuff on here, but the site also boasts a healthy library of both free and pay-per-view movies.</p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> YouTube is mostly free, but if you use the site\u2019s video-on-demand service, you can expect to pay anywhere from $0.99 to $3.99 for each flick you rent.\u00a0You\u2019ll have 2 days to watch the movies once you start it, and every rental will expire after 30 days. Alternatively, you\u00a0can also purchase movies from YouTube and have access to them forever. Purchase prices are generally as low as $9.99 and usually not higher than $19.99.</p> <p><strong>Availability:</strong> Absolutely everywhere. If it has a color display and can connect to the Internet, chances are good that it can play YouTube videos.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> There are going to be those nights when\u00a0you can\u2019t find anything to watch, so you just start YouTube\u2019ing random topics that pop into your head. No matter how big the libraries of Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon get, they\u2019ll never have trampoline accident compilations or footage of people lighting their farts on fire \u2013 and for those\u00a0reasons, YouTube will always enjoy a spot on the video-streaming podium.</p> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-music-itu\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-754876 size-full\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2015/04/iTunes-header-pic-1.png\" alt=\"iTunes Browse\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/movies?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play</a></h3> <img class=\" size-full wp-image-755714 aligncenter\" src=\"http://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/google-play-header-pic-1-970x647.png\" alt=\"Google play header pic 1\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> <p>Google continues their quest for domination with Google Play. The media hub has a great selection of newly released movies and TV shows are usually available the day after airing. They\u2019ve even been known to offer a free movie once in a blue moon. I downloaded the <em>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</em> for the great price of zero dollars. So keep your eye out.</p> <p><strong>Content: </strong>Google Play has a good selection of new releases. They\u2019re also pretty good with current TV shows. Their on-demand format is similar to Vudu or iTunes, and at this point, Google Play is a great supplement to sites like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video.</p> <p><strong>Price: </strong>Renting a movie will cost $5 for HD and $4 for standard definition. With rentals, you\u2019ll have two days to watch movies once you start it, and rentals will expire after 30 days. Buying movies will almost always cost less than $20 and you\u2019ll have the option to stream in HD.</p> <p><strong>Availability: </strong>Google Play will stream in HD quality on every Android device running 4.0 or later. This includes the Android TV box and Android TV. It also works with Google Chromecast and Playstation 4. Other devices (including Apple products) can still stream movies from Google Play in SD.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Google Play is great for new movies, but the fact that Google Play isn\u2019t available on every device doesn\u2019t bode well. The pay-per-content model is great for getting the newest releases but those rental fees will add up quick. But it\u2019s a good place to start, if you\u2019re looking for a movie. They often have killer deals.</p> <p>We\u2019ve already covered services from Google, Amazon, and major TV broadcasters, so this list just wouldn\u2019t be complete without any mention of Apple\u2019s streaming service. Apple realized long ago that physical media was dying and was among the first companies to create a digital music storefront for MP3\u2019s. Over the years, it quickly became clear that DVD\u2019s would soon be a thing of the past and Apple started building\u00a0its\u00a0video library as well.</p> <p><strong>Content:</strong> iTunes has a solid collection of both movies and TV shows. You\u2019ll find a good number of new releases in the store as well as a sizable library of older flicks and series that are no longer on the air.</p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> The iTunes Store operates on a pay-per-content model, so even though it has a large selection of media, you can expect to pay more here than you would for a subscription-based service. Apple gives you the option of renting or buying movies\u00a0TV episodes, and if you know you\u2019ll want to catch every episode of a particular show, you can purchase a MultiPass, which gives you access to one episode plus the next 15 episodes for a fixed price.</p> <p><strong>Availability</strong>: iTunes is a downloadable app for most mobile devices and computers, but is generally missing from any streaming box that isn\u2019t an Apple TV.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Apple scores big points for content selection and purchase options, but gets demerits for not being readily available on every device. The pay-per-content scheme also gets expensive if you consume a lot of movies and TV, so we suggest using iTunes to fill in the gaps left by Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu.</p> </div> <div> <h3><a href=\"http://www.vudu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vudu</a></h3> <img class=\" size-full wp-image-754879 aligncenter\" src=\"http://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/vudu-header-pic-1-970x647.png\" alt=\"vudu header pic 1\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\"> <p>Amazon may be the Walmart of the Internet, but that\u2019s not stopping Walmart from getting in on the online streaming game. Vudu is Walmart\u2019s pay-per-content store, and the brick-and-mortar behemoth is giving all it has to make sure that Vudu becomes a household name.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: Vudu has content comparable to what you\u2019ll find on the YouTube or iTunes video marketplace. It\u2019s a hodgepodge of movies and TV shows, but overall the content veers toward more feature-length movies. Walmart does a good job of offering new releases at around the same time that they come out on DVD. Vudu will also host any Ultra Violet digital copies that may be available with the movies you buy with a free digital locker service.</p> <p><strong>Price</strong>: Vudu is a pay-per content store, so you can expect to pay just as much for a digital movie rental as you would for a physical copy. Digital rentals typically start around $3.99, and go up from there depending on the video and audio quality you want. 1080p movies with Dolby Digital Plus surround usually go for $5.99</p> <p><strong>Availability</strong>: You can get Vudu on Xbox 360, Play Station 3, Mac, and just about any set-top streaming box. Vudu smartphone apps are also available on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Although it\u2019s definitely not as good as the others listed on this page, it still makes the top five simply because it has more to offer than services like Epix and<br> Crackle, to which we\u2019ll give an honorable mention.</p> </div> </div> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>Amazon and Netflix are definitely the two best choices for movie watchers, Hulu Plus is the undisputed winner when it comes to TV shows, and Sling TV is best for Live TV. We recommend a\u00a0combination to get the most bang for your buck. Sports fans will want to combine Netflix or Amazon Instant with Sling TV, and if you\u2019ve got stock in currently-airing TV, you\u2019ll also want to consider Hulu Plus. There\u2019s a bit too much of an overlap in content between Netflix and Amazon to make it sensible to subscribe to both.</p> <p>YouTube and iTunes are great for filling in the gaps. If you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for in your subscription-based streaming library, there\u2019s a high likelihood that you can find it in a pay-per content store like iTunes or Vudu. Mix and match TV streaming services for the best results!</p> <p><strong>Updated April, 22, 2015:\u00a0</strong><em>This article has been updated since it was originally published to include Sling TV and reflect design and price changes in Netflix, Hulu, and Vudu.\u00a0</em></p> </article>"], "link": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-media-streaming-services-version-1429724876/"},

Granted, the setup didn\u2019t offer quite as many features as actually wearing a FitBit device, but it was hard not to view the move as sign of things to come.</p> <p>Later in the year, JawBone, which had its own successful UP line of fitness bands, announced compatibility with Android Wear. Fitness trackers aren\u2019t direct competitors with smartwatches in terms of pricing, but the space they occupy appears to be steadily shrinking as more advanced wearables perform many of the same functions.</p> <h3>It\u2019s not just a band, it\u2019s an ecosystem</h3> <p>If modular wearables are the future, as I suggested last week, we can foresee a time when big, bulky wearables have gone the way of the dodo in favor of discreet, embedded sensors. Should that future come to fruition, the smartphone will likely continue to be the key piece to the puzzle. A variety of sensors collecting various bits of data across our bodies still require a device to serve as a mainframe. Misfit is once again taking things a step further by integrating aspects of home automation into its offering.</p> <a class=\"wp-image-756447\" href=\"http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/misfitwatchapp_1-1500x1000.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px;\"><span class=\"zoom-button\"></span><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-756447\" src=\"http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/misfitwatchapp_1-640x640.jpg\" alt=\"misfit apple watch app\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"></a> <p>This is good news for smartphone makers, of course \u2014 and could also prove a boon for the company that is able to lock users into their wearable software ecosystem right now. Companies like FitBit, Misfit and Jawbone almost certainly don\u2019t want us thinking about their current hardware offerings as the gateway to a software-focused future. They\u2019d much rather convince you to purchase an activity tracker now with the assumption that the category will stick around for good.</p> <div class=\"simplePullQuote h-nonessential\"><p>How will fitness companies make money with apps?</p> </div> <p>Once you\u2019ve picked one up, if you\u2019re satisfied with the software experience, perhaps you\u2019ll be a customer for life \u2014 even as the definition of what you\u2019re consuming continually changes. After committing to a user-interface and a proprietary fitness social network, it\u2019s that much more difficult to change allegiances \u2014 especially if that move means losing all of the fitness data you\u2019ve been tracking over the years.</p> <p>There is some precedence for this. The e-reader market springs to mind. Look at companies like Kobo and Barnes &amp; Noble with the Nook, which branched out from devoted e-readers to software applications. Like fitness apps, these sync information across devices and operating systems, eventually freeing users to take advantage of their offerings without the need for e-readers at all, as they used the Kobo or Nook app on their smartphone or tablet.</p> <h3>Shaking the money out of an app</h3> <p>It\u2019s not a one-to-one comparison, and the contrast does present some interesting questions, chief among them is monetization. For e-reader manufacturers, the money was never in the e-reader as much as it was in books \u2013 they earned a cut every time someone bought one.</p> <p>How will fitness companies make money with apps? There are a lot of possibilities. Advertising, in-app purchases and charging for the app all come to mind, but at the moment, none seem particularly plausible as a standalone revenue stream. The answer is, of course, data. Think about how much advertisers and research groups are willing to pay for user search and surfing analytics. Now imagine that kind of information in a real-world setting.</p> <div class=\"dtads-inject-hook\" style=\"display:none\"></div> <p>We\u2019re talking about sensors tracking user movements, habits, location and all manner of different metrics feeding into a single app and database. It\u2019s a sort of a holy grail for the companies out there currently looking to sell you things. The more you know about a consumer, the easier it is to make a sale \u2014 and this is about as close as we can come at the moment to cracking open a skull and reading what\u2019s inside.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t an attempt at fear mongering \u2014 the information will no doubt be gathered anonymously and many companies will almost certainly offer an opt-in, based on past and present privacy fears about data collection. But collecting data will almost certainly play a role in the business model of wearable companies moving ahead.</p> <p>Of course, all of that\u2019s still a ways off. The fitness trackers still sell. But it\u2019s easy to see how a confluence of factors could lead to a leveling off and the eventual erosion of the category, making room for future innovations in the space. And who can blame manufacturers for trying to get out in front of that curve?</p> </article>"], "link": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/why-fitbit-and-misfit-apps-will-save-them-from-smartwatches/"},

Around the end of April, the <a href=\"https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-16486\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Note 4</a> on the Uncarrier\u2019s network also got Lollipop 5.0.</p> <p>Galaxy S5 owners throughout Europe are also slowly but surely receiving the Lollipop update, with the remaining U.S. phones close behind.

He would revise that law a few years later to every two years. The law has driven the advance of technology at a rapid pace, right up to our latest smartphones.</p> <p>As chips have become increasingly powerful and faster, however, manufacturers have struggled to keep up the pace.\u00a0Analysts have questioned how much longer Moore\u2019s Law can go, on but one analyst\u00a0suggests that Intel will adapt by trying new techniques, such as a technology called a quantum well.</p> <p><strong>Related</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/moores-law-celebrates-fiftieth-birthday/\">Moore\u2019s Law celebrates its 50th birthday</a></p> <p>David Kanter, writing for his own site,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.realworldtech.com/intel-10nm-qwfet/\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Tech</a>, predicts that Intel will develop 10nm Quantum Well Field Transistors (QWFET) instead of the FinFET transistors currently used. The technology is difficult to understand or explain without a PhD in physics, but here\u2019s the basics.</p> <p>A quantum well occurs when trapped electrons take on a quantum state, which causes them to only exist at discrete energy levels. This is useful, since it allows greater control over the electron\u2019s behavior. The QWFET uses this quantum well effect, and is also built in three dimensions, so it retains the favorable characteristics of three dimensional FinFET transistors.</p> <p>QWFETs look set to be scaled down to 0.5V. That will\u00a0outperform a standard FinFETs, which by comparison can be scaled down to 0.7V. If accomplished, this would lead to transistors that require less power to achieve a particular level of performance. That helps Intel chase Moore\u2019s Law, as it means more transistors can be packed into a certain power envelope. Combined with a reduction in production process to 10nm, QWFETs should provide a sharp increase in efficiency.</p> <p>Kanter goes on to predict that Intel will begin producing these 10nm QWFETs later this year or in early 2016. If for some reason the technology can\u2019t be ramped up in time for the 10nm chips, they\u2019ll be delayed and used as 7nm transistors in 2017 or 2018. He\u00a0has been tracking the research of Intel for years, noting that the company has been researching quantum wells for over a decade and also points out a paper by\u00a0<a href=\"http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2010/11/enforcing_moores_law_through_t/\" target=\"_blank\">Intel researchers writing about QWFETs</a> back in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cOnce Intel\u2019s researchers showed that it was possible to create FinFET QWFETs,\u201d writes Kanter, \u201cit became clear to me that this technology was headed out of research, into development, and ultimately into processors that would be on the market.\u201d</p> <p>Kanter says he first made these predictions privately back in 2012 to friends but has now decided to go public.\u00a0He provides a detailed prediction on what he believes Intel\u2019s process will be, even forecasting what materials will be used to be combined with silicon.</p> <p><strong>Related</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/new-details-revealed-about-intels-upcoming-60-core-behemoth/\">Intel has a crazy 60-core processor in the works</a></p> <p>He anticipates that Intel will use InGaAs (Indium Gallium Arsenide) or InSb (indium tin) for the n-type channel and strained germanium for the p-type channel.</p> <p>Intel hasn\u2019t commented on any of Kanter\u2019s remarks. Other industry heavyweights like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have stayed relatively quiet on their own research into new materials. In any case, Intel would be well ahead of the competition, as usual. Most other chip foundries are just now starting to use the FinFET design Intel put into production several years ago.</p> <p>The supposed slowing down of Moore\u2019s Law has caused the industry to look at new methods and materials, such as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-02-17/gallium-nitride-is-it-the-silicon-replacement-\" target=\"_blank\">Gallium Natride (GaN)</a>, which was exhibited earlier this year by Efficient Power Conversion.</p> <p>Kanter is also keen to point out that this is all \u201cinformed speculation\u201d on his part and concedes that he may be wrong too and it will be some time before we find out. \u201cIn reality, it will take months or years for Intel and the rest of the industry to reveal their plans for 10nm and 7nm,\u201d he writes.</p> <div class=\"simplePullQuote h-nonessential\"><p>QWFETs may help notebook battery life continue its improvement, making all day endurance the rule.</p> </div> <p>If he\u2019s correct, though, the impact could be dramatic.
