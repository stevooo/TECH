Killing SeaMicro doesn\u2019t mean that AMD has given up altogether on server products, but it does throw a wrench into the mix; dense servers were one of the high-growth areas that Rory Read (repeatedly) identified in various discussions about the future of the company during his tenure as CEO.

The old days, where a simple die shrink automatically brought faster chips and lower power consumption, are now gone. Today, companies perform a die shrink (which makes most aspects of the chip perform <em>worse</em>, not better), and then find supplementary technologies that can improve performance and bring yields and power consumption back to full. Analyst and RealWorldTech owner David Kanter has published a paper on where he thinks Intel is headed at the 10nm node, and predicts the tech giant will deploy a pair of new technologies at that node \u2014 quantum well FETs and III-V semiconductors.</p>", "<p>We\u2019ve talked about <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/170356-beyond-7nm-and-silicon-the-first-iii-v-cmos-wafers-roll-off-production-lines\">III-V semiconductors first</a>, so we\u2019ll start there. Intel has been evaluating next-generation semiconductor materials for years. We first spoke with Mark Bohr about the company\u2019s efforts back in 2012. The <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/166413-post-post-pc-the-new-materials-tech-and-cpu-designs-that-will-revive-overclocking-and-enthusiast-computing\">III-V semiconductors</a> are called that because the materials are drawn from Groups III and V of the periodic table. Many of these materials have superior performance compared with silicon \u2014 either they use less power or they allow for drastically higher clock speeds. But they cost more and often require extremely sophisticated manufacturing techniques. Finding materials to replace both the p-channel and n-channel has been difficult, since some of the compounds used for one type of structure don\u2019t work well for the other.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.realworldtech.com/intel-10nm-qwfet/\">Kanter predicts</a> that Intel will use either InGaAs (Indium Gallium Arsenide) or InSb (indium tin) for n-type, and strained germanium or additional III-V materials for the p-type channel. The net effect of this adoption could cut operating voltages as far as 0.5v. This is critical to further reducing idle and low-use power consumption, because power consumption today rises as the square or cube of voltage increase (depending on leakage characteristics and overall transistor type).</p>", "<p>The other major advantage that Kanter thinks Intel may deploy is the use of quantum well structures. Quantum wells trap electrons by surrounding them with an insulating structure that leaves a limited number of dimensions for the electrons to move in. This new fin structure and gate are shown in the image below, from an Intel IEDM paper in 2011.</p>", "<p>Combined, these new structures would allow Intel to substantially cut power consumption while simultaneously improving other characteristics of the transistor\u2019s performance. It\u2019s not clear if this would enable substantially faster chips. Intel has focused primarily on making its CPUs more efficient in the past five years, as opposed to making them faster. And while a Core i7-4790K is unquestionably quicker than a Core i7-2600K from 2010, the gap isn\u2019t what it would\u2019ve been ten years ago.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s possible that these new structures would run at substantially higher clock speeds. But building chips smaller also means decreasing feature sizes, which <em>increases</em> the formation of hot spots on the die. The ability to run chips at 0.5v is great for the Internet of Things, but it\u2019s not necessarily great if the chip needs 1.1V to hit maximum clock.</p>", "<p>Kanter addresses why he wrote this piece, noting he believes that \u201cindustry experts should make insightful, specific, verifiable predictions that have a definite time horizon.\u201d It makes sense that Intel would go for some of these capabilities. The firm is known to be researching III-Vs, and quantum wells have apparently been worked on for a decade or more. Intel likes to talk up its manufacturing capabilities and advantages, and this type of innovation at the 10nm node could give them a huge leg up over the competition.</p>", "<p>Samsung and TSMC haven\u2019t revealed much about their own plans, but it\u2019s highly likely that both firms would stick with conventional FinFET designs at 10nm, just as Intel spent two design cycles using their own standard Tri-gate technology. If TSMC actually closes the gap with Intel at 10nm, III-Vs and QWFETs would give Intel an argument for claiming it\u2019s not just the number of nanometers that makes the difference \u2014 it\u2019s the process tech as well.</p>", "<p>If Intel adopts these technologies at 10nm, it\u2019ll <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/190845-intel-forges-ahead-to-7nm-without-the-use-of-euv-lasers\">push back the window on EUV</a> farther, back to 7nm \u2014 and possibly require additional verification and validation that the tool sets are compatible with both the new semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the requirements of EUV itself. Such a move would likely push EUV introduction back into the 2018-2019 timeframe, assuming that 10nm shipments begin in 2016-2017, with 7nm ready 2-3 years later.</p>", "<p>Intel supposedly delayed installation of 10nm equipment until December of this year, but is planning to <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/199636-intel-at-isscc-14nm-in-the-bag-full-steam-ahead-on-10nm\">ramp production at its facilities</a> in Israel.</p>"], "link": "http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/203926-analyst-intel-will-adopt-quantum-wells-iii-v-semiconductors-at-10nm-node"},

The chip can also bypass its branch predictor completely in circumstances where it is performing poorly and save additional power in the process.</p>", "<p>The Cortex-A72 is still capable of decoding three instructions per clock cycle, but apparently adds some instruction fusion capability to increase efficiency.

ARM has even managed to shave off some die size \u2014 the Cortex-A72 is supposed to be about 10% smaller than the Cortex-A57, even on the same process.</p>", "<p>Ars Technica reports that according to ARM, the Cortex-A72 can even beat the Core M in certain circumstances.

She then went on to say:</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat we also are factoring in is, you know, with the Windows 10 launch at the end of July, we are watching sort of the impact of that on the back-to-school season, and expect that it might have a bit of a delay to the normal back-to-school season inventory build-up.\u201d AMD could be wrong, of course, but it\u2019s unlikely \u2014 the company almost certainly knows when Microsoft intends to launch the new operating system, and this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard rumors of a summer release date for the OS.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s possible that AMD intends to capitalize on the launch with a new push around the GPU architecture its currently expected to launch in approximately the same time frame. The company wouldn\u2019t need to launch alongside the operating system, but hitting the streets a few weeks early would build buzz around DX12 and other performance enhancements baked into Windows 10 before the actual OS debuts.</p>", "<p>The big question on everyone\u2019s mind in the PC industry is going to be <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/191295-how-to-download-and-install-the-windows-10-technical-preview\">whether Windows 10 lives up to the hype</a>. So far, it seems as if it will. I\u2019m not claiming people will be lining up around the blocks to grab it, but I think there\u2019s a decent chance that Windows 7 users, who gave Windows 8 a pass, will investigate Windows 10 \u2014 especially given the <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/198964-dx12-confirmed-as-windows-10-exclusive-amd-and-nvidia-go-head-to-head\">long-term advantages of DirectX 12.</a></p>", "<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3PPXX9fa5U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "<p>It\u2019s not clear yet how quickly games will transition to the new API, or how long they\u2019ll support both DX12 and DX11. From past experience, we\u2019d expect to see high-end AAA games popping out in DX12 in short order (the Star Wars Battlefront title that debuted last week will be DX12). Plenty of other games will transition more gradually, however, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise us to see a few DX9 titles still knocking about \u2014 indie games and small developers have very different budgets compared with the big game studios.</p>"], "link": "http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/203827-amd-leaks-plans-for-upcoming-windows-10-launch"}]
