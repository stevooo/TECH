# TECH - A Technology news website


For my university major project I created a technology news website called TECH, this website gathers technology news stories from reputable news websites.

TECH is a one stop website to read the latest technology news from several different sources in one place. TECH also lets users create their own personalised technology news homepage by setting preferences on the categories of technology news they like to read.

This website works by using a tool called Scrapy to scrape news websites to gather the stories for the website. Then each story is put into a category of technology news then stored into a PostgreSQL database for use in the website. Users on this website can create their personalised technology news homepage by signing up for a TECH account and setting preferences on the types of news they like to read.
