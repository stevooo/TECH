                <p>TECH is a technology news website created to be a one stop website for- all technology news, the stories on TECH are from other news websites such as BBC News technology, Skynews and Techradar.
                   The purpose of this website is so you don't have to view multiple websites to find interesting technology news. 
                   A benefit of TECH is you can create an account to build your own personal technology news home page by setting preferences on what type of technology you like to read.

                    TECH was created by Stephen McFarlane as his final year web-based project for his Internet programming and service administration course at Aberystwyth University.
                    It was created because of his fascination with reading about technology and he liked the idea of having stories from multiple websites in one place.
