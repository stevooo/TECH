The 'last mile' is much discussed, but much more important is the 'middle mile' \u2013 and that means deep ocean cables. A whopping 99% of international data is transmitted along the bottom of the ocean via submarine communications cables, with new, high-cost and high-tech projects planned to further boost global broadband speeds.</p>", "<p>\"Submarine cables are critical to supporting the internet, carrying virtually all traffic back and forth across the world,\" says Kaveh Ranjbar, Chief Information Officer, RIPE NCC, one of five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). \"Their importance means that there are a lot of them, which in turn means the internet has redundancies in place in the event one section does get damaged,\" he says. </p>", "<p><figure><img src=\"http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"Underwater cables\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/Miscellaneous/underwater%20internet%20feature/underwater%20internet%202-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/Miscellaneous/underwater%20internet%20feature/underwater%20internet%202-320-80.jpg 320w, http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/Miscellaneous/underwater%20internet%20feature/underwater%20internet%202-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\"><figcaption>Fishing trawlers frequently destroy undersea cables near the coast</figcaption></figure></p>", "<p>Earthquakes and natural disasters are rare, but deadly. \"When we had the tsunami in Japan in 2011 it destroyed nearly all of the cables in the area,\" says Jean-Luc Vuillemin, Senior Vice-President, International Backbones &amp; Networks at Orange Marine. Five years previously, an earthquake severed 80% of the cable connections between Taiwan and the world, wiping out half of Hong Kong's internet capacity and leaving its banks floundering.</p>", "<p>However, the biggest problem is with ships' anchors and the fishing industry. \"The problem isn't at all with sharks, as I read in some newspapers, but fishing trawlers, especially near the coast,\" says Vuillemin, \"so we bury the marine cables up to 3m in the seabed, especially near the coast.\" </p>", "<p>All this is why the network now has so much redundancy. \"A cable break is problematic as a minimum of two to three weeks is required before it will be functioning again,\" says Eric Loos, Senior Product Manager Capacity &amp; IP, BICS, whose 75 submarine cables have 200 landing points.</p>", "<p>The process goes something like this \u2013 a global consortium proposes a new high-speed cable to link two disparate countries, and invites investment from global capital and any country along the way that wants to benefit. National governments, telecoms companies or private investors then contribute to the construction of the cable, and pay for a landing station to connect to it.</p>", "<p>Take Orange Marine's Sea-Me-We 5, a 20,000km-long cable that will link France and Singapore from 2016, with 18 cable landing points in 17 countries including Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. For a developing country, a new cable passing nearby is a huge \u2013 and hugely expensive \u2013 opportunity. </p>", "<p>For instance, the Bangladeshi government has taken a <a href=\"http://www.thedailystar.net/idb-offers-44m-for-second-undersea-cable-38684\">loan</a> of $44 million (around \u00a329.5 million, AU$56.6 million) from the Islamic Development Bank to help pay its total contribution of $72.5 million (around \u00a348.7 million, AU$93.3 million) towards the SMW5 cable. Of the total, $40 million (around \u00a326.9 million, AU$51.4 million) is for the deep-sea cable's manufacture and installation, and $32.5 million (around \u00a321.8 million, AU$41.8 million) is for the branch cable and landing station.</p>", "<p>Neighbouring Myanmar's decision to also link to SMW5 made it cheaper for Bangladesh to join to it. The stakes are high \u2013 Bangladesh's current internet bandwidth total is around 200Gbps thanks to the sole submarine cable it links to, though it also has overland links to Indian cables. By the time SMW5 is completed, the country will have seven times more capacity. </p>", "<p>\"Landing stations can be open or closed,\" says Vuillemin. \"If it's open, all telecom operators can connect to the cable, but if it's closed, only the operator that has paid for the landing station can connect.\" The cable is being manufactured at one end by Alcatel-Lucent and from the Singapore end by NEC, and laid using one of Orange Maritime's four cable-laying ships. </p>", "<p>\"Fast web access can have transformative powers on developing communities, especially when you think of it in terms of access to education, and better communications during disaster scenarios,\" says Liam Fisher at Built Invisible.</p>", "<p>Rather incredibly, there's a new project called Arctic Fibre whose 15,000km will pass through the frozen North West Passage \u2013 the Canadian and Alaskan Arctic \u2013 to directly connect Tokyo with New York and London.</p>", "<p><figure><img src=\"http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"Doug Madory director of Internet analysis at Dyn\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/Miscellaneous/underwater%20internet%20feature/underwater%20internet%204-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/Miscellaneous/underwater%20internet%20feature/underwater%20internet%204-320-80.jpg 320w, http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/Miscellaneous/underwater%20internet%20feature/underwater%20internet%204-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\"><figcaption>Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Dyn</figcaption></figure></p>", "<p>\"Arctic Fibre is a novel and ambitious project that, if successful, would potentially achieve the fastest internet route between New York City and Tokyo, as well as providing high speed internet to cities in northern Canada and Alaska,\" says Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Dyn, whose blog contains some fascinating investigations into <a href=\"http://research.dyn.com/2014/12/whats-next-cuba/\">Cuba's</a> lack of submarine cables and on <a href=\"http://research.dyn.com/2014/07/no-turning-back-russia-crimea/\">Russia</a> secretly activating the Crimean cable.</p>", "<p>\"The Arctic Fibre team is having to contend with issues that have never before been faced by a submarine cable installation project \u2013 it's another example of the amazing work engineers are doing out there to create a more resilient and performant internet.\"</p>"], "link": "http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/the-incredible-story-of-the-underwater-internet-1291295"},

Available initially for Android smartphones and tablets, Good's solution protects your log-in credentials in a secure container, separate from Google's operating system. </p>", "<p>By isolating credentials into a separate container, Good says that even if Android gets compromised, malicious software won't be able to intercept your passwords or PINs. </p>", "<p>Chief technology officer Nicko van Someren says that Good was able to deliver this feature based on the TrustZone architecture on ARM-based processors. ARM processor cores can run the Android OS and have a secure component to house the separate trusted operating system to handle PINs. </p>", "<p>By migrating security to the hardware - in this case, a component of the ARM chip - Someren says that this approach is equivalent to having an enterprise-grade smart card for your phone or tablet. To use TrustZone, devices must have a ROM that supports this feature. Most high-end Android devices already ship with a TrustZone support today. </p>", "<p>As part of its vision to expand secure mobility, Someren says that Good's Trusted Execution Environment solution will help change the perception of Android. Current enterprise activation number is about three to one between iOS and Android, with businesses favoring Apple's operating system because of security. </p>", "<p>However, that may change as Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) will be able to protect login credentials even if Android is fully attacked. </p>", "<p>As the credentials and the authentication lives outside of the rich operating system - Android - and inside the trusted operating system, malware would not be able to penetrate. User's credentials cannot be accessed even if the device is rooted, and malicious attacks cannot intercept the user's PIN or log keystrokes.</p>", "<p>Someren says that the TEE requires a trusted code, which is signed, to authenticate. This makes it secure and reduces friction as users no longer need complicated passcodes with hardware-based security.</p>", "<p>In addition to achieving greater security in the event of a malicious code attack on Android, TEE also provides the benefit of simple PINs. Organizations and IT managers could ease requirements to allow shorter PIN codes without compromising security.</p>", "<p>TEE will be able to authenticate itself with the back-end server using a PIN and the device's hardware. </p>", "<p>Like Microsoft's <a href=\"/news/software/security-software/device-guard-safeguards-windows-10-with-hardware-authentication-1291767\">Device Guard</a> for Windows 10, Good's TEE will also allow horizontal single sign-on. Once a user authenticates with the system, the user will automatically be signed on to other apps that are part of Good's suite. This suite includes over 1,600 partner and customer applications developed on the Good Dynamics Secure Mobility Platform. </p>", "<p>Someren and his team demonstrated horizontal single sign-on on an Android Kyocera smartphone. With Good's suite installed, a user would log into Good, and a user would also be logged on to connected apps, like Microsoft's Lync communication tool. </p>", "<p>In the past single sign-on across different third-party apps was not possible because it would expose the log-in credentials. This is no longer the case with TEE.</p>", "<p>TEE will be available to customers starting May.</p>"], "link": "http://www.techradar.com/news/software/business-software/good-delivers-smart-card-level-authentication-to-android-phones-1291786"},
