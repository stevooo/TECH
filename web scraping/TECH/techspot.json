Above the battery is Apple's Taptic Engine, which is a linear actuator that provides haptic feedback paired with a subtle speaker.</p>", "<p>Behind the Taptic Engine and the battery is where the Apple S1 processor can be found, housing basically all of the chips required for the smartwatch's operation\u00a0including the CPU, GPU, RAM, NAND and wireless radios. iFixit notes that the S1 is actually pretty difficult to remove, and it's unlikely that this will be an upgradeable part as was originally rumored.</p>", "<p><img src=\"http://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2015-04-24_02-45-57.jpg\"></p>", "<p>Underneath the S1 is a range of sensors, and around the edges are connectors for the clever digital crown, and the side button. Many of the components are well integrated and sealed, as the Apple Watch is IPX7 water resistant, allowing submersion in 1 meter of fresh water for up to 30 minutes.</p>", "<p>Several of the Apple Watch's components appear to be quite difficult to access and replace, especially in the 38mm model that iFixit tore down. The 42mm model is expected to have a slightly larger battery, but an internal layout that's largely the same. If you need to replace something from inside the smartwatch, it might be best to leave it to Apple.</p>"], "link": "http://www.techspot.com/news/60473-ifixit-tears-down-apple-watch.html"},

The Mail app in particular has received a ton of new stuff, such as swipe gestures for flagging and deleting emails, and a revamped authoring experience that \"leverages the familiar and rich capability of Word\".</p>", "<p>Microsoft has also improved Continuum, which is Windows 10's way of modifying system behavior depending on whether a device is being used in a tablet mode with a touchscreen, or in a laptop/desktop mode with a keyboard and mouse. In the latest build of Windows, Microsoft has tweaked Continuum to make certain UI elements more touchable when in tablet mode.</p>", "<p>There are several new theming features in the latest Windows 10 build, including a black system theme, transparency for the Start menu and Taskbar,\u00a0the ability to resize the Start menu, and new coloring options.
