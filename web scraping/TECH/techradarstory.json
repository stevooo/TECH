You either love it or hate it. Either way, you probably need to get used to seeing it around.

We\u2019ve narrowed the list down to some of the most important ones available, and we\u2019ll be sure to continue refining as the list expands. </p>", "<p>You can\u2019t have an enterprise-ready device without somehow tying it back to Salesforce. In partnership with Apple, the CRM giant created a tool, Analytics Cloud for Apple Watch, that offers users the ability to analyze and take action on data. Users can swipe from dashboard to dashboard to explore real-time data, and perform voice-based search to bring up reports and dashboards. </p>", "<p>Additionally, Salesforce1 for Apple Watch is built to provide notifications to employees. Managers can send updates to their teams via the Watch to let them know when goals have been reached, when emergencies have occurred, or when it\u2019s quitting time, among other uses. </p>", "<p>If you\u2019re willing to do the leg work, and you\u2019re a Salesforce customer, you can use the Salesforce Wear Developer Pack to develop your own apps that tie back to Salesforce\u2019s reporting. </p>", "<p>Want to step out for lunch, but you\u2019re afraid to miss that important client call? Unified communications specialist, ShoreTel, has developed a tool that will route your desk phone to your Apple Watch so that you can hear voicemail, transfer calls, and conference into meetings. </p>", "<p>You can also program the app to let you view and respond to unread instant messages, receive meeting notifications, and more. Now you can be \u201cunreachable\u201d on your watch too! </p>", "<p>If you\u2019re one of those managers that likes to be in touch with your employees at all times, Betterworks has developed an app for the Apple Watch that is designed to help teams track and achieve goals. Managers program assignments into the app, where everyone on the team is able to use their Watches to track progress (or lack thereof). Users can also message one another from within the application. </p>", "<p>Similar to Salesforce, but designed for smaller businesses, Bottomline is a sales tracking tool that gives business owners the power to monitor sales, customer requests, inventory, and more. You can also view PDF dashboards on the Watch so that you can better understand which products are outselling others, which stores have more foot traffic, and which salesperson sold more goods, among other uses. </p>", "<p>For consultants and other hourly workers who have a hard time managing when they started which job and when they clocked out, Invoice2go has created an Apple Watch application that lets you clock in and clock out of jobs via your wrist. The Watch app also notifies you when payments have been processed, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check in with your clients\u2019 grumpy payroll managers. </p>"], "link": "http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/the-best-business-apps-for-your-apple-watch-1292089"},

Might as well be down the mines, amirite?</p>", "<p>Someone somewhere hired an external agency to park a huge coach that said \"Wake Up\" on its side to \"wake\" the iSheeple \"up\". After everyone on the internet muttered \"er, desperate much?\" in Samsung's direction, Samsung Australia released a statement saying that it had \"nothing to do with the Wake-Up Campaign \" and <a href=\"/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/rim-was-behind-apple-store-wake-up-protests-1078237\">RIM (now BlackBerry) was forced to own up to the whole thing</a>.</p>", "<p>It can't have escaped your notice that the <a href=\"/reviews/phones/mobile-phone-accessories/apple-watch-1264567/review\">Apple Watch</a> went on sale today - it certainly didn't escape Samsung's. In a plan you just know has been in the works since before the release date was announced, the Korean company chose today, April 24, Apple Watch Day, to tease a new round-faced Galaxy Gear. </p>", "<p>If this has changed your mind about opting for the Apple Watch over a Gear, please write in to the usual address. </p>"], "link": "http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/5-tech-firms-that-tried-to-steal-their-rivals-thunder-1292020"},
