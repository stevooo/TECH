Marvel, also known as the House of Ideas, has a stable of 8,000 characters covering every storytelling style imaginable. Characters such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye and many others are dead center in the public consciousness thanks to their success on the big screen.</p>", "<p>Telltale\u2019s episodic style of game design and distribution has been used to offer fans <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/game-of-thrones/\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/the-walking-dead/\"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/back-to-the-future/\"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/jurassic-park/\"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, and the Vertigo comic book series <em>Fables</em>. Given the episodic nature of comic books, the relationship between Marvel and Telltale makes a lot of sense.

Whether the games will take cues from the cinematic universe or the comic book one (or both) remains to be seen at this point, but the one solid piece of information \u2014 a 2017 release \u2014 might offer some insight. That year a trio of Marvel Studios movies are hitting the big screen: <em>Guardians of the Galaxy 2</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, and <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>.

The <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch</a> is no exception to this.

And in the case of water resistance, the Apple Watch delivers.</p>", "<p>Australian YouTube channel FoneFox decided to put the Apple Watch Sport through a rather extreme <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/waterproof/\">waterproofing</a> test.

That means it should be able to withstand immersion of up to 1 meter. In the test it survives cold water splashes, hot water and soap in a shower scenario, being fully submerged in a bucket of cold water for 5 minutes, and repeated submersion and movement in a swimming pool at depths of up to 1.2 meters for 5 minutes at a time. In all cases, the Apple Watch kept on working flawlessly.</p>", "<p>I\u2019m guessing most consumers wearing an Apple Watch will be on high alert if it starts to rain, will remove the watch for showers, and leave it in a locker when swimming. This video shows you can put the Apple Watch in more extreme wet conditions, however, Apple does not claim you can do these things, and your device could be more or less water resistant than the one on test here.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple_watch_wet_01.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1621346\" src=\"http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple_watch_wet_01-590x330.jpg\" alt=\"apple_watch_wet_01\" width=\"590\" height=\"330\"></a></p>", "<p>So the takeaway from this is: be careful around water when wearing an Apple Watch, but if it does get soaking wet or falls in a bucket of water, it\u2019s probably going to be just fine.

Each LED brick is 1 x 1 size, so you can put them nearly anywhere, and bridge bricks are similarly flexible.</p>", "<p>I\u2019ve played with some LEGO sets with gimmick light and sound bricks in the past, but they\u2019ve always been bulky and awkward. And LEGO Mindstorms is an amazing robotics kit, but once you start having to thread wires it ceases to be a LEGO build and starts to be an engineering project. This is an interesting, simple solution.</p>", "<p>The Build Upons Kickstarter has a goal of $90,000.

The PC always comes out on top because of all the additional performance a high-end rig offers. For the <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/xbox-one/\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tag/ps4/\">PS4</a>, though, it\u2019s much closer. The PS4 typically ends up being better, achieving 1080p much more frequently as well as higher (sustained) frame rates.</p>", "<p>In the case of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> due out next month, developer CD Projekt Red has stated the PC version runs at 1080p/60fps, the PS4 version at 1080p/30fps, and the Xbox One version at 900p/30fps. It seems that <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-23-microsoft-apologises-for-using-pc-footage-in-xbox-one-witcher-3-trailer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft overlooked this</a> when it posted the latest trailer for the game yesterday implying it was the Xbox One version being shown.</p>", "<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrXxdy9Qgpk?rel=0?wmode=transparent\" width=\"590\" height=\"332\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "<p>Viewers soon noticed it was running at 1080p/60fps and therefore was not the Xbox One version. Microsoft has apologized for any confusion caused. It was simply using footage supplied to it by CD Projekt Red, which was of course captured on a PC so as to show off the game in the best light. The description on the video has since been updated to reflect this fact.</p>", "<p>I\u2019m sure this was just an oversight on the part of the person handling the Xbox YouTube channel. It actually brings back memories of when I\u2019d go into a shop as a kid, pick up a game (on cassette) and check out the screenshots on the back of the case. They were never for the version of the game I was buying, always the best graphical version which inevitably was on the most expensive format the majority of kids didn\u2019t own.
