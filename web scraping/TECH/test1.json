He was keen to get pictures of himself and his wife together - but passers-by couldn't always be trusted. </p>", "<p>\"When I was in the Louvre Museum in Paris, I asked a child to take a photo of us, but when I stepped away, the child ran away with my camera,\" he says. </p>", "<p>It was a problem crying out for a solution - and as an engineer in Minolta's development department, Ueda was well-placed to find one. </p>", "<p>He came up with the \"extender stick\" - an extendable stick with a tripod screw that was designed for use with a new, small, camera. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing.</p>", "<p>\"The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked,\" says Ueda. </p>", "<p>The concept encountered some resistance - Minolta's testing department found that women in particular were very embarrassed by the idea of taking photos of themselves. \"The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then,\" says Ueda. </p>", "<p>Nonetheless, Minolta went ahead with it, he says, \"because the idea was fantastic\". </p>", "<p>The extender was patented in 1983 but, to Ueda's disappointment, it was not a commercial success. </p>", "<p>\"It didn't sell very well,\" he admits. \"The quality of the picture wasn't very good.\" </p>", "<p>Nevertheless, he kept faith with his invention. \"I use it all the time. Even 30 years ago, when the product stopped selling, I always, always carried a pocket camera and extender stick with me,\" he says. \"It's like an extension of my arm. Whenever I want to extend it, I pull it out, and whenever I'm just walking around, I fold it up.\"</p>", "<p>Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, at least a decade before the recent boom in selfie sticks, but he's philosophical about this. </p>", "<p>\"My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.\" </p>", "<p>Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, who has studied selfies going back as far as the 1840s, says the quest to include the photographer in a group photo is nothing new.  One of the best-known devices to facilitate that was of course the camera self-timer. This relied on using a tripod or finding a suitable surface to rest the camera, and running to join the group. With variable results. </p>", "<p>Pritchard believes the selfie stick's time has come partly because of optical developments which make lenses work better at short distances. Another factor is the portability of mobile phone cameras - traditional cameras were simply too heavy to put on the end of a long pole. </p>", "<p>But the Canadian toy and gadget inventor Wayne Fromm believes there's just one reason the selfie stick has become so popular: his own hard work. </p>", "<p>He developed the Quik Pod, a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s. He was unaware of Ueda's earlier design, though he too came up with the idea during a European holiday. </p>", "<p>\"We were constantly having to scope strangers who might be amenable to taking our picture,\" he says, recalling the trip with his daughter, Sage. \"You're sitting there waiting, hoping they speak English\u2026That's when I had the idea - what if this camera could be suspended in the air, as if somebody was taking the picture for us?\" </p>", "<p>On their return, he began researching umbrella technology. \"I would buy umbrellas and take them apart - my daughter would come downstairs and see me study 20 different umbrellas, so she probably thought I was a little bit crazy,\" he says. </p>", "<p>Aimed at the adventurous traveller, Fromm's product is impervious to sand and water and has all sorts of extras, like quick-release heads - to avoid the indignity of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/strngwys/status/552936158682836992/photo/1\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">answering calls with the selfie stick still attached</a>.  </p>", "<p>He's spent the past decade promoting his invention at trade fairs, on the QVC shopping channel and on TV shows like Dragon's Den. \"It was a 10-year 'overnight' success,\" he says. </p>", "<p>Fromm disclosed Ueda's extender in his patent as \"prior art\", but he believes the current selfie stick craze is a direct result of his own model. \"It happened because of my work, and I can show a paper trail of that. There's lots of knock-offs of my product that actually have my daughter's picture on the packaging. The factories have been studying my product all of these years, basically stealing the photos as well,\" he says. </p>", "<p>\"This is why I say I invented what we call today's selfie stick.\" </p>", "<p>Fromm's product, unlike Ueda's, has sold well, but there are plenty of others profiting from it too, by producing cheap knock-offs. So many, in fact, that it is impossible to pursue them all. </p>", "<p>\"It's like ants at a picnic: you can't step on them all. It basically went viral and it would be a waste of my emotional energy to start fighting the world over this sort of thing,\" he says.  </p>", "<p>Besides, says Fromm, for inventors like him and Ueda it's not all about the money. \"It's that you're actually creating something fun or useful or helpful for people. So I'm happy that the world has embraced the selfie stick.\" </p>", "<p>But has anything been lost? What about that brief interaction between strangers, the kind exchange of a favour? Fromm doesn't miss it. \"Once you break silence with strangers,\" he says, \"they feel they have the right to continue to talk to you.\"  </p>", "<p><strong>Chindogu</strong></p>", "<p>It was while scanning mail-order catalogues that Kenji Kawakami came up with the idea of <i>chindogu </i>- Japanese for \"strange tools\". He has thought up hundreds of bizarre and absurd items such as funnel glasses (to guide eye drops) or the train nap cap (to avoid head-lolling while asleep on public transport). </p>", "<p>The International Chindogu Society also keeps an eye out for unlikely <a href=\"http://www.chindogu.com/?page_id=708\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">inventions that are a reality</a> - like the suitcase scooter. </p>", "<p><i>Hiroshi Ueda spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service. </i><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02p997f\" class=\"story-body__link\">Listen again on iPlayer</a><i> or </i><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/outlook\" class=\"story-body__link\">get the Outlook podcast</a><i>. </i></p>", "<p><i>Subscribe to the </i><a href=\"http://bbc.in/1iP3Jrd\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter</a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.</i></p>"], "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32336808#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa"},

It helps express a fundamental part of human experience,\" he said.</p>", "<p>But, he acknowledged, paper does face competition from digital tools.</p>", "<p>To address this Moleskine has formed partnerships with firms such as Adobe and Livescribe, a provider of electronically-enabled pens.</p>", "<p>In 2012 it hooked up with Evernote to create a paper-digital hybrid notebook.</p>", "<p>Evernote, the quintessential Silicon Valley start-up that promised to digitise our productivity, now has 100 million users.</p>", "<p>Its partnership with Moleskine created smart notebooks which mean users can photograph their paper notes and place them in Evernote's app where they become catalogued, searchable digital content. </p>", "<p>The notebooks have a special layout to make it easy to capture handwriting while smart stickers allow users to sort and search the notes.</p>", "<p>Smart notebooks offer to bridge the physical and digital worlds as part of an increasing move to eliminate the waste and confusion that piles of paper creates.</p>", "<p>And our paperless journey does not end there. </p>", "<p>Look around you on your next commuter journey and far fewer people are negotiating unwieldy newspapers - opting instead to read their news via a smartphone or tablet.</p>", "<p>Get off the train and the sea of commuters are much more likely to flow through the barriers with the swipe of a smartcard or credit card, while paper tickets are becoming a rarity at airports too.</p>", "<p>Even our interactions with government are taking a decidedly digital turn, with the UK government scrapping the paper car tax disc and people now routinely filling in tax returns electronically.</p>", "<p>According to the American Forest and Paper Association, total US paper shipments decreased by 5% in February, compared to the same time last year while anecdotal data suggests that we use a third less paper than 20 years ago.</p>", "<p>Despite this, the industry remains pretty healthy - last year the US produced about 21 million tons of paper - equivalent to between 55 to 110 million trees, according to some estimates.</p>", "<p>And in offices, paper remains a key tool. According to sustainability charity Wrap (Waste and Resources Action Programme), the average office worker uses up to 45 sheets of paper per day, of which over half is considered waste while office productivity firm Iron Mountain estimates that only a paltry 1% of offices are truly paperless.</p>", "<p>\"Paper is declining slowly, but the sky is not going to fall in any time soon,\" said Mick Heys, an analyst at research firm IDC.</p>", "<p>\"I now board a plane by showing an electronic ticket on my phone, but I still have a paper passport and that document is going to take a while to replace.\"</p>", "<p>Offices are making incremental steps towards reducing their paper loads - and even something as simple as a print management system, which will cancel jobs not printed overnight or restrict how many emails can be printed out, can reduce paper use by up to 20%, according to Mr Heys.</p>", "<p>\"But paper remains better for some things and people like it. Studies have shown that learning from a screen activates a different part of the brain to learning from paper,\" he added.</p>", "<p>So it seems paper will be with us for a while longer - which, if nothing else, will probably please a generation of bored schoolchildren for whom the humble paper aeroplane can still provide some much-needed distraction.</p>"], "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32130647#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa"},

It's the not-for-profit multilingual online encyclopaedia co-founded by Jimmy Wales and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation. The English-language version of the Wiki contains nearly five million articles and has an estimated 25 million users.</p>", "<p>Anyone can - it's open to all and can be modified and edited by anyone. However, Wikipedia's administrators protect some pages from direct editing if they believe they are regularly subjected to \"vandalism\" - the addition of abusive language or falsehoods.</p>", "<p>Wikipedia is self-policing and relies on its community of volunteer editors to improve the quality and accuracy of the pages over time. It's the \"wisdom of crowds\" principle in action. Writers are encouraged to back up factual statements with verifiable references and authoritative sources as often as possible.</p>", "<p>Wikipedia has rules - lots of rules. One obvious one is not being dishonest. Another is avoiding opinion and sticking to verifiable facts. But it is possible to set up a user account with a pseudonymous username to allow you to edit anonymously. However, using anonymous accounts for blatant misrepresentation and puffery - known as sock puppetry - is often spotted and the offending content challenged or removed by other editors. </p>", "<p>Blatant self-promotion is frowned upon by the community and viewed as a conflict of interest. Anyway, as you don't control the page, less flattering information may soon be added by others. But examples of Wikispam, as it's sometimes called, are \"speedily deleted\" according to the website.</p>", "<p>You don't need to log in to the site to read or edit articles, but setting up an account and registering allows you to create your own pages, upload content and edit without your internet protocol (IP) address - the number that identifies a mobile phone or computer on a network - being visible to the public.</p>", "<p>The 1,300-or-so Wiki administrators can usually identify the IP address of someone editing articles, and this can be tracked to a rough location, enabling them to spot suspicious patterns of behaviour. Offending accounts can be suspended, without individuals necessarily being identified. </p>", "<p>Er... yes. If the IP address is different - you use a different computer or phone than the one you used before and, if you're being really sneaky, move location to do your editing - there's no reason why you can't set up another anonymous account and carry on as before. And there are plenty of services allowing internet users to hide their IP addresses anyway, for example, by using an encrypted virtual private network. </p>", "<p>Someone going to great lengths to hide their IP address is sometimes enough to arouse suspicion amongst the site's administrators. And patterns of behaviour - from the adoption of similar usernames to a focus on specific topics and types of edit - can reveal a lot about motivations and personality. Multiple accounts can often be tracked to one individual - we're never as anonymous as we like to believe. But any open and collaborative system will always be open to abuse.</p>"], "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32412121#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa"},
