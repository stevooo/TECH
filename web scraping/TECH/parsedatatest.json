In Microsoft's two-stage preview approach, fast ring customers get releases earlier than customers in the slow ring, but may encounter more bugs or issues. </p>", "<p>In this release, customers will now have access to the new Mail and Calendar apps.

Available initially for Android smartphones and tablets, Good's solution protects your log-in credentials in a secure container, separate from Google's operating system. </p>", "<p>By isolating credentials into a separate container, Good says that even if Android gets compromised, malicious software won't be able to intercept your passwords or PINs. </p>", "<p>Chief technology officer Nicko van Someren says that Good was able to deliver this feature based on the TrustZone architecture on ARM-based processors. ARM processor cores can run the Android OS and have a secure component to house the separate trusted operating system to handle PINs. </p>", "<p>By migrating security to the hardware - in this case, a component of the ARM chip - Someren says that this approach is equivalent to having an enterprise-grade smart card for your phone or tablet. To use TrustZone, devices must have a ROM that supports this feature. Most high-end Android devices already ship with a TrustZone support today. </p>", "<p>As part of its vision to expand secure mobility, Someren says that Good's Trusted Execution Environment solution will help change the perception of Android. Current enterprise activation number is about three to one between iOS and Android, with businesses favoring Apple's operating system because of security. </p>", "<p>However, that may change as Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) will be able to protect login credentials even if Android is fully attacked. </p>", "<p>As the credentials and the authentication lives outside of the rich operating system - Android - and inside the trusted operating system, malware would not be able to penetrate. User's credentials cannot be accessed even if the device is rooted, and malicious attacks cannot intercept the user's PIN or log keystrokes.</p>", "<p>Someren says that the TEE requires a trusted code, which is signed, to authenticate. This makes it secure and reduces friction as users no longer need complicated passcodes with hardware-based security.</p>", "<p>In addition to achieving greater security in the event of a malicious code attack on Android, TEE also provides the benefit of simple PINs. Organizations and IT managers could ease requirements to allow shorter PIN codes without compromising security.</p>", "<p>TEE will be able to authenticate itself with the back-end server using a PIN and the device's hardware. </p>", "<p>Like Microsoft's <a href=\"/news/software/security-software/device-guard-safeguards-windows-10-with-hardware-authentication-1291767\">Device Guard</a> for Windows 10, Good's TEE will also allow horizontal single sign-on. Once a user authenticates with the system, the user will automatically be signed on to other apps that are part of Good's suite. This suite includes over 1,600 partner and customer applications developed on the Good Dynamics Secure Mobility Platform. </p>", "<p>Someren and his team demonstrated horizontal single sign-on on an Android Kyocera smartphone. With Good's suite installed, a user would log into Good, and a user would also be logged on to connected apps, like Microsoft's Lync communication tool. </p>", "<p>In the past single sign-on across different third-party apps was not possible because it would expose the log-in credentials. This is no longer the case with TEE.</p>", "<p>TEE will be available to customers starting May.</p>"], "link": "http://www.techradar.com/news/software/business-software/good-delivers-smart-card-level-authentication-to-android-phones-1291786"},

If you're thinking some big, spaceship-like contraption, you'd traditionally be right.

It is well thought out, expertly designed, sturdy, powerful and reasonably priced for its value proposition to customers. This Dell system sticks to the big box approach, standing large at 438 (h) x 216 (w) x 545mm (d) (16.95 x 8.50 x 20.67 inch) and 14kg (31lb.), unlike Apple Mac Pro's minimalist look-and-feel and HP Z1 G2's all-in-one approach. Despite its size, two integrated aluminum handles, one at the front and one at the back, moving the bulky workstation is deceptively easy and ergonomically sensible.</p>", "<p>Within the Dell Precision T7610 lies a full-size Extended ATX motherboard with an Intel C602 chipset.

The first is that the resolution is limited by the number of pixels you've got on the sensor, and the second is that each one is sensitive to only red, green or blue light and the camera has to interpolate (guess at) the full colour data for a pixel by using the data from those around it.</p>", "<p><figure><img src=\"http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"Pentax K 3 II\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/cameras/Pentax/K-3%20II/Press%20shots/004_k3_2-05-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/cameras/Pentax/K-3%20II/Press%20shots/004_k3_2-05-320-80.jpg 320w, http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/cameras/Pentax/K-3%20II/Press%20shots/004_k3_2-05-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\"><figcaption>Externally, the K-3 II is almost identical to the K-3 before it.

Device Guard will join Windows 10's three-pronged approach to security this <a href=\"/news/software/operating-systems/microsoft-announces-windows-10-summer-launch-1288646\">summer</a>, alongside <a href=\"/news/software/operating-systems/windows-10-s-biometric-security-recognizes-fingers-faces-and-eyes-1288607\">Microsoft Passport and Windows Hello</a>.</p>", "<p>Our current version of security is that we trust everything until antivirus programs - like McAfee, Norton and Windows Defender - tells us otherwise, says Hallum. However, there are unknown threats out there that remain undetected until the threats are known. At that point, there will already be victims and data would have been compromised.</p>", "<p>Moving away from this model, Microsoft Trustworthy Computing corporate vice president Scott Charney proposes that companies should whitelist apps and migrate to hardware-based authentication.</p>", "<p>With each version of Windows, Microsoft has evolved the way it approaches security for its desktop operating system. </p>", "<p>On Windows 7, Microsoft uses a software approach. However, that changed to a hardware-based strategy starting with Windows 8, which uses a platform secure boot through a feature called Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or UEFI, to prevent BIOS-based firmware attacks.</p>", "<p>On Windows 10, Microsoft is continuing its focus on hardware security with a hypervisor-based solution to create a trusted secure mode with Device Guard.</p>", "<p>Device Guard offers better malware protection by blocking any app other than trusted apps. This essentially creates a whitelist of apps for your organization to use, and locks the system from new or unknown malware attacks.</p>", "<p>Ingalls says this begins with the Local Security Authority (LSA) to create a virtual secure mode that prevents hash attacks. The virtual secure mode runs outside of the main operating system to keep things safe, even if the operating system is compromised. </p>", "<p>Then, we move to kernel mode integrity component. This moves the Code Integrity outside of the kernel, and Windows checks to see if a software package has been officially signed by Microsoft or a trusted publisher. This prevents rogue or malicious software from running in what Microsoft terms as user mode code integrity. </p>", "<p>Ingalls says that the hypervisor-based approach keeps things safe by moving the security feature outside of the main OS and is hardware-dependent. When an app is run, Windows determines if the app is trustworthy. By using hardware and virtualization to isolate this decision-making process outside of Windows, Device Guard remains secure and safe, even if a malicious code gains access to full system privileges.</p>", "<p>In effect, by requiring applications to be signed through the Code Integrity program along with the hardware-based hypervisor feature, Device Guard creates a whitelist of applications that can run on a system.</p>", "<p>\"This is an architectural change to the system, not just another [antivirus] solution, and it contains elements from Windows Phone,\" said Hallum.</p>", "<p>Microsoft says that Device Guard is a newly coined name, but the feature has been around and is in use on Windows Phone. By vetting apps in the Store and requiring apps to be digitally signed, Microsoft says that its approach, compared to the competing Android operating system, significantly reduces the risk of malicious attacks.</p>", "<p>Ingalls says that apps can be signed in two ways. Publishers can submit their apps to Microsoft for a digital signature as the easy and quick approach. </p>", "<p>For enterprises with proprietary code and data, and publishers who may not want to expose their apps to Microsoft, the company will provide tools for them to sign their own apps to run on their systems.</p>", "<p>In order to use Device Guard, Ingalls says that any device that's certified for Windows 8 will be compatible. Essentially, you'll need a device that supports hypervisor, including any device that supports Intel's VT-D. To support the complete features of Device Guard, Microsoft says that it will work with hardware partners to roll out systems that are Device Guard certified.</p>"], "link": "http://www.techradar.com/news/software/security-software/device-guard-safeguards-windows-10-with-hardware-authentication-1291767"},
